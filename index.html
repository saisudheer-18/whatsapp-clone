      <div class="message sent">Hello ma'am! 🙏 I'm a huge admirer of you and Virat sir. The way you both balance your personal and professional lives is truly inspiring! 💫</div>
      <div class="message sent">I recently saw your pictures from Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya — they radiated such peace and devotion.🛕✨</div>
      <div class="message received">Thank you so much! 😊 Visiting Ayodhya was a soul-touching experience for me. I’m really glad you connected with it. 🕊️</div>

      <div class="message sent">Ma'am, if you ever visit Andhra Pradesh, please consider the *Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Temple* (also known as **Kanaka Durga Temple**) in Vijayawada. 🛕 It's perched atop the Indrakeeladri hill beside the Krishna River — a self-manifested shrine to Goddess Kanaka Durga, revered since ancient times.</div>
      <div class="message sent">Legend says Sage Indrakeela did penance here, and the goddess appeared to slay Mahishasura, hence the name *Indrakeeladri*. It’s believed Goddess Durga is *Swayambhu*, deeply potent and alive in that sacred idol.</div>
      <div class="message sent">There are over **400 stone steps** leading to the top — each step climbed feels like a journey inward. On reaching, you see her eight-armed form, radiant with weapons and ornaments, standing over Mahishasura. The air hums with ancient energy.</div>
      <div class="message sent">During **Navratri/Dussehra**, the temple becomes a golden paradise — each day a different form of the goddess is worshipped: Swarna Kavacha, Annapurna, Saraswati, to name a few. The grand finale, Theppotsavam, is a majestic boat procession on the Krishna — truly a sea of devotion and light.</div>
      <div class="message sent">Pilgrims come in tens of thousands, lighting ghee lamps by the riverbanks, offering sarees at the goddess’s feet (especially during *Ashada Sare Utsavam*), chanting with tears of love — it's a celebration of faith that transforms you.</div>
      <div class="message sent">Standing there with the river flowing beneath, the city laid out beyond, and the divine presence in that sanctum — it stays with you long after. It's not just a visit; it's **a soulful pilgrimage**. 🌸✨</div>
      <div class="message received">That feels so deeply moving… I can almost feel the devotion through your words. 🌺 I’d love to experience that sacred energy myself.</div>
      <div class="message received">This recommendation is so heartfelt — I'll treasure it and plan to visit someday soon. 🙏💞</div>

      <div class="chat-date">June 18, 2025</div>
      <div class="message sent">Definitely, ma’am! And there’s one more hidden gem you might love — *Hamsaladeevi*. 🌊</div>
      <div class="message sent">It’s where the Krishna River meets the Bay of Bengal — also known as ‘Sagara Sangamam’. The place has a small temple called *Venugopala Swamy Temple*, and the vibes are calm and divine. 🕉️🐚</div>
      <div class="message sent">Not many people know, but it's a perfect place to reflect, especially during sunrise and sunset. 🌅</div>
      <div class="message received">Wow, I had no idea about Hamsaladeevi! It sounds like such a peaceful and spiritually rich location. Thank you for sharing this! 🧘‍♀️</div>

      <div class="chat-date">June 19, 2025</div>
      <div class="message sent">You're most welcome, ma'am! These places truly represent the soul of Andhra Pradesh — full of devotion, rivers, traditions, and serenity. 💖</div>
      <div class="message sent">If you ever make the trip, it would be deeply meaningful for the people here. 😊</div>
      <div class="message received">That means a lot. Your messages are filled with warmth and love — thank you again. I'll surely keep Andhra Pradesh in my heart and plans! 🌺🙏</div>
